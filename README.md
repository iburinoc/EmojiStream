Have you ever decided you wanted to use roughly the amount of bandwidth a 56k modem could support, but still wanted to have a video chat app that could fully represent your facial expressions (as long as your facial expressions are entirely picked from this set: {:smile:})?  Well then we've got the ~app~ dependency-laden python program for you!

Example:
![Very expressive](/data/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

As you can see, we save on bandwidth by heavily pixelating the image, but still get the benefits of the facial expressions through emoji.
